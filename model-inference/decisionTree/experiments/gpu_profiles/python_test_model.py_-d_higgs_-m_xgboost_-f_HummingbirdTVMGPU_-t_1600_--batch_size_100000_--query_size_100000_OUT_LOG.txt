DATASET: higgs
MODEL: xgboost
FRAMEWORK: HummingbirdTVMGPU
Query Size: 100000
Batch Size: 100000
Trees 1600
Depth 8
LOADING higgs test
Time Taken to load higgs as a dataframe is: 5027.620315551758
LOADING:  /home/ubuntu/netsdb/model-inference/decisionTree/experiments/models/higgs_xgboost_1600_8.pkl
[20:57:44] WARNING: /home/conda/feedstock_root/build_artifacts/xgboost-split_1660208897656/work/src/learner.cc:627: 
Parameters: { "verbose" } might not be used.

  This could be a false alarm, with some parameters getting used by language bindings but
  then being mistakenly passed down to XGBoost core, or some parameter actually being used
  but getting flagged wrongly here. Please open an issue if you find any such cases.
